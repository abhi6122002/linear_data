**Title:** ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression on a Simple Dataset

**Description:**
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** using Python to model and predict continuous values from a simple dataset. It covers the complete machine learning workflow â€” from data preparation to model evaluation â€” making it a beginner-friendly introduction to regression analysis.

**Key Features:**

* Uses **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** for data handling & visualization.
* Implements **Scikit-learnâ€™s LinearRegression** for model training.
* Visualizes the regression line and residuals.
* Evaluates the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² score**.
* Includes a well-commented Jupyter Notebook for learning purposes.

**Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

**How to Run:**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

**Dataset:**
A simple CSV dataset containing **X** (independent variable) and **Y** (dependent variable) values is included for demonstration.

**Use Cases:**

* Predicting sales from advertising budget
* Estimating house prices from size
* Understanding relationships between two variables

If you want, I can also make a **GitHub README.md file with proper formatting, code blocks, and dataset preview** so it looks professional and recruiter-friendly.
Do you want me to prepare that?
